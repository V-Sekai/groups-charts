# Groups Charts

**CURRENTLY INCOMPLETE USE CAREFULLY**

A library of charts plotted in Control, 2D and 3D nodes to visualize general-purpose datasets.  

## What is this?

*Groups Charts* is a collection of Control, 2D and 3D nodes to plot charts.

Charts are helpful for visually representing values powerfully and more understandably, mainly when these charts also have visually pleasing features. 

Use these charts to plot some values in it, take a screenshot, or use it in a Godot Engine's game or project.

# Available Charts and when to use them   

This library offers a set of charts for each type of Godot Node:   
- **Control Nodes:** "Control Charts" are fast Charts that can be plotted in a Control space, such as UIs or Control user interactable areas. They offer basic Control properties, such as Margins, size inheritance and Control. No animations, no real-time changes, only charts.   
- **2D Nodes:** "2D Charts" is a set of Charts that can be used in 2D spaces. They offer additional tools, such as animations and real-time changes in the editor. In addition, they can be used to implement more aesthetic charts in 2D contexts.   
- **[wip] 3D Nodes:** "3D Charts" is a set of Charts that can be used in both 2D and 3D spaces. They offer the possibility to plot 3D datasets standard in machine learning contexts or data analysis. A Camera Control will also be available, which can be used to move around the chart.   

### Available Charts
